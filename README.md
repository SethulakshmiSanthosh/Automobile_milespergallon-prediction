 # Predicting Fuel Efficiency of Vehicles

In this series, we'd be going from data collection to deploying the Machine Learning model:

1. **Data Collection** - we are using the classic [Auto MPG dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Auto+MPG) from UCI ML Repository.
2. **Define Problem Statement** - We'll frame the problem based on the dataset description and initial exploration.
3. **EDA** - Carry our exploratory analysis to figure out the important features and creating new combination of features.
4. **Data Preparation** - Using step 4, create a pipeline of tasks to transform the data to be loaded into our ML models.
5. **Selecting and Training ML models** - Training a few models to evaluate their predictions using cross-validation.
6. **Hyperparameter Tuning** - Fine tune the hyperparameters for the models that showed promising results.
